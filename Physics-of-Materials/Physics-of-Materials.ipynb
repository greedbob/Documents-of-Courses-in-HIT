    "1 What is the wave-particle duality theory? Does any matter have both wave and particle characteristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)在量子力学里，微观粒子有时会显示出波动性，有时又会显示出粒子性，在不同条件下分别表现出波动或粒子的性质。\n",
    "波粒二象性指的是微观粒子显示出的波动性与粒子性。波动所具有的波长与频率意味着它在空间方面与时间方面都具有延伸性。而粒子总是可以被观测到其在某时间与某空间的明确位置与动量。\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, microscopic particles sometimes show volatility, sometimes showing particle properties, and exhibiting fluctuations or particle properties under different conditions.\n",
    "Wave-particle duality refers to the volatility and particle properties exhibited by microscopic particles. The wavelength and frequency of fluctuations means that it is both spatially and temporally extensible. Particles can always be observed for their clear position and momentum at a certain time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy $\\varepsilon=h\\nu$；The momentum $p=\\frac{h}{λ}$\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)Yes, The wavelength is called De Broglie wavelength. $λ=\\frac{h}{mv}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2 What is the uncertainty principle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot both be known to arbitrary precision, and the more precisely one property is known, the less precisely the other can be known.\n",

    "3 Wavefunction and its meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wave function is a mathematical tool used in quantum mechanics to describe the momentary states of subatomic particles, and it is expressed $Ψ(x,y,z,t)$ or $Ψ(\\overrightarrow{r},t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the wave function is probability amplitude, and the square of its absolute value gives the probability distribution that the system will be in any possible state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 The solution of Schrodinger equation of the particles bound in one-dimensional potential wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schrodinger equation $\\frac{-\\hbar}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\Psi}{\\partial x^{2}} + U\\Psi = i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For potential is not related with time and one-dimensional situation, $\\Psi(x,t)=\\psi(x)e^{\\frac{-iEt}{\\hbar}}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schrodinger equation is $-\\frac{{\\hbar}^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\psi}{\\partial x^2} + U\\psi = E\\psi$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the range of $x\\leqslant 0$ or $x\\geqslant a$, $U=\\infty$, so $\\psi=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the range of $0\\leqslant x\\leqslant a$, $U=0$, $\\frac{-\\hbar}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\Psi}{\\partial x^{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "let $k^2=\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + k^2\\psi = 0$, thus $\\psi(x) = A\\cos{kx}+B\\sin{kx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "at point of $x=0$ and $x=a$, $\\psi(x)=0$, thus \\begin{equation}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\\psi(0)=A=0\\\\\\psi(a)=B\\sin{ka}=0 \\end{array} \\right.\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "thus $ka = n\\pi$, $k=\\frac{n\\pi}{a}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$k^2=\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}$, so $E_n = \\frac{k^2\\hbar^2}{2m} = n^2\\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2} (n=1, 2, 3 ...)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\psi(x)=B\\sin{\\frac{n\\pi}{a}x} (0<x<a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the normalization condition, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} {\\left|\\psi(x)\\right|}^2 dx = \\int_0^a B^2 \\sin^2{\\frac{n\\pi}{a}x} dx = \\frac{1}{2}aB^2 = 1$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7 Use the theory of energy band to explain what is the insulator, semiconductor and conductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metal conductivity is very high: the highest energy band filled by electrons, in metal, is not full，furthermore，the density of electron in the energy band is very high and it has the same magnitude as the density of the atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insulator conductivity is very low: there is a large energy gap between the empty band and the full band, which suggests that very huge excitation energy is required to carry the electrons up over the gap into the next band. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for semiconductor, the energy gap is small. There can be a small, but not zero, density of electrons excited into the empty band. These electrons can easily carry a current, which would increase rapidly at high temperature.\n",

    "如果半导体材料中导带和价带中的电子和空穴的动能相同的话，则该半导体可以称之为直接带隙半导体。其导带最小值（导带底）和满带最大值在k空间中同一位置，电子要跃迁到导带上产生导电的电子和空穴（形成半满能带）只需要吸收光子的能量。\n",
    "\n",
    "If the kinetic energy of the electrons and holes in the conduction band and the valence band are the same in the semiconductor material, the semiconductor may be referred to as a direct bandgap semiconductor. The minimum conduction band (the bottom of the conduction band) and the maximum value of the full band are in the same position in the k-space, and electrons must transition to the conduction band to generate conductive electrons and holes (forming a half-full band) only need to absorb the energy of the photon.\n",
