    "#### 推导平均自由程\n",
    "The mean distance traveled by molecules between successive collisions, called the mean-free path $λ_{mfp}$, is an important property of the gas that is dependent on the pressure. To calculate $λ_{mfp}$ we note that each molecule presents a target area $πd^2_c$ to others where $d_c$ is its collision diameter. A binary collision occurs each time the center of one molecule approaches within a distance $d_c$ of the other. If we imagine the diameter of one molecule increased to $2d_c$ while the other molecules are reduced to points, then in traveling a distance $λ_{mfp}$ the former sweeps out a cylindrical volume $πd^2_cλ_{mfp}$. One collision will occur under the condition that $πd^2_cλ_{mfp}=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "连续碰撞之间的分子行进的平均距离，称为平均自由路径$λ_{mfp} $，是取决于压力的气体的重要特性。 为了计算$λ_{mfp} $，我们注意到每个分子向其他人提供目标区域$πd^ 2_c $，其中$ d_c $是其碰撞直径。 每当一个分子的中心接近另一个分子的距离$ d_c $时，就会发生二元碰撞。 如果我们想象一个分子的直径增加到$ 2d_c $而其他分子减少到点，那么在行进距离$λ_{mfp} $时，前者扫出圆柱体积$πd^2_cλ_{mfp} $。 在$πd^2_cλ_{mfp} = 1 $的条件下会发生一次碰撞。\n",

    "#### 影响材料蒸发速率的因素\n",
    "A liquid has a specific ability to evaporate at a given temperature. Furthermore, the maximum evaporation rate is attained when the number of vapor molecules emitted corresponds to that required to exert the equilibrium vapor pressure while none return. These ideas led to the basic equation for the rate of evaporation from both liquid and solid urfaces, namely,\n",
    "\n",
    "液体具有在给定温度下蒸发的特定能力。 此外，当发射的蒸汽分子的数量对应于在没有返回时施加平衡蒸汽压力所需的蒸汽分子的数量时，获得最大蒸发速率。 这些想法导致了液体和固体表面蒸发速率的基本方程，即，\n",

    "#### 合金蒸发行为/合金蒸发中如何保持配比\n",
    "* When the interaction energy between A and B atoms of a binary AB alloy melt are the same as between A-A and B-B atom pairs, then no preference is shown for atomic partners. Such is the environment in an ideal solution\n",
    "* Metallic solutions usually are not ideal, however. This means that either more or less B will evaporate relative to the ideal solution depending on whether the deviation from ideality is positive or negative, respectively. A positive deviation occurs when B atoms are physically bound more tightly to each other than to the solution, facilitating their tendency to escape or evaporate.\n",
    "* 二元金属合金中，当两种原子的接触能相等，相互之间没有优先的选择性，则蒸发将保持比例。\n",
    "* 然而，一般的金属合金都不是理想的，蒸发组分会发生偏移，原子键合力强的元素蒸发得多。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first is to evaporate from two (or more) independent pure metal melts maintained at different temperatures.\n",
    "* the melt composition of a single source is continuously adjusted through external mass additions. This has the effect of replenishing the loss of the more volatile species and maintaining a constant melt height, which would otherwise recede. Eventually the desired steady-state evaporation flux ratio is established\n",
    "* 采用两个或多个分立的纯金属蒸发源，并保持各自的蒸发温度。\n",
    "* 通过不断加入被蒸发材料到蒸发源中，调整单个蒸发源的成分，补充易蒸发组元的成分损失，保持熔融体的体积。\n",

    "    * Roughening of surface. Under ion bombardment various micron-sized surface structures such as cones, pyramids, ridges, ledges, pits, and faceted planes form. \n",
    "* Crystallography and texture:\n",
    "    * With increasing ion energy, the interplanar spacing sometimes peaks and then diminishes, suggesting that gas and associated defects are first incorporated, but then partially anneal out. \n",
    "    * Preferred orientation or preponderance of certain planes lying parallel to the substrate plane.\n",
    "* Grain structure inclding grain size and morphology:\n",
    "    * Ion bombardment promote nucleation and interrupt the grain growth process frequently, resulting in small grain size. The grain size falls as the average energy per depositing atom rises, but then remains constant above this value due to structura1 annealing caused by ion bombardment at high energy. \n",
    "* Defects and stress:\n",
    "    * Ion bombardment generates defects, the density of which will increases in concert with the change in grain size, as ion-energy rises and temperature falls.\n",
    "    * Some gas will be trapped within the solid film, which may generate residual compressive film stress. \n",
    "* Compositional Modification of Surfaces:\n",
    "    * Ion bombardment is effective in cleaning substrates and promoting subsequent film adhesion.\n",
    "    * However, the same gases used to rid the surface of contaminants may also react with the substrate.With much higher ion energy, sputtering or etching of the substrate will happen. Resputtering effects dominate at the highest ion energy.\n",

    "#### 推导电极电压与电极面积的关系\n",
    "The equivalent circuit of the sputtering systems can be thought of as two series capacitors--one at the target sheath region ($C_RF$), the other at the grounded substrate ($C_G$) with the applied peak RF sheath voltage (V) divided between them. Since capacitance is proportional directly to the electode area (A) and inversely to the sheath thickness $d_s$, $V_RF/V_G = c_G/c_RF = (A_G/A_{RF})[d_s(RF)/d_s(G)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "for collision-free ion motion in the sheath, the current and its DC self-bias potential are related by the Child-Langmuir equation $j=\\frac{4E_0}{qd_s^2}(\\frac{2q}{m})^\\frac{1}{2}V^\\frac{3}{2}$\n",
